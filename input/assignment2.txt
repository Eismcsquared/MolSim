# Lines of comment start with '#' and are only allowed at the beginning of the file
# Empty lines are not allowed.
# The first line not being a comment has to be one integer, indicating the number of molecule data sets.
#
# Molecule data consists of
# * xyz-coordinates (3 double values)
# * velocities (2 or 3 double values)
# * mass (1 double value)
# Optionally, it may contain
# * size of cuboid (number of particles in x, y, z direction)
# * the distance between particles in a cuboid
# * the average velocity of Brownian motion
# Especially, if the optional parameters are specified, the corresponding data set is interpreted as a cuboid
# consisting of particles.
